# OneKash Labs

**Open Source. Modern. Your tools. Your data. Your rules.**

We build privacy-focused apps for everyday life. No tracking. No accounts. No nonsense.

## Apps

- **[KashCal](https://kashcal.github.io)** — A modern calendar that works offline and syncs with iCloud
- **[KashCake](https://github.com/KashCal/KashCake)** — Never forget a birthday. Syncs with contacts, stays on your device
- **KashTime** — Timers and stopwatches that respect your focus *(coming soon)*

## Power Tools

- **[iCloud Calendar MCP Server](https://github.com/icloud-calendar-mcp/icloud-calendar-mcp)** — MCP server for iCloud Calendar integration

## Philosophy

- **Your data is yours** — It lives on your device. We never see it, store it, or sell it.
- **Open by default** — All our code is public.
- **Design matters** — Beautiful interfaces aren't just for Big Tech.
- **Does one thing well** — Each app has one job. It does it well.
